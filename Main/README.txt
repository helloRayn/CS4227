Alright, so what we need is to set up a main class for the operation of the program.
	This will either be Game, or will be instantiated by Game (Such as instance.runGame() etc.)
	This will link together everything we have so far.
	We also need to flesh out the individual parts of the project, get the AI working and the Items properly decorated.
	The Factory should work but I'm not sure. I didn't know what to fill the rooms with...
	
	I'll need to triple check the patterns we are using also.
	We will need to CLEARLY label where they are being used so that he will not need to look for them.
	
	I'll talk more tomorrow or whenever.
